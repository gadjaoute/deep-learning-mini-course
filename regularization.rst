Regularization
*********************

Regularization is the practice in deep learning of reducing the complexity of a neural network while training in order to reduce the problem of overfitting.

  Overfitting
  ------------
**Overfitting** takes place when the neural network picks up on unwanted “noise” in the training data which causes the network to be less accurate when given different data from the same problem set. In simpler terms the neural network is finding patterns or traits in the data that we do not want to be used in it’s calculations. The most common cause of overfitting is building a neural network that is too complex for the task assigned. When the neural network is too complex it will pick up on patterns that are caused by randomness in the data. To fix the problem of overfitting **regularization** is used.
