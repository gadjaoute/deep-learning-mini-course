A neural network is a system that consists of layers of nodes which activate at various levels dependent on previous layer’s nodes. This system is a set of algorithms designed to recognize patterns by interpreting data such as images, sounds, text, or time to be processed and produce an output. Neural networks are differ from logistic regression in that the “weight” of input values are calculated more than once between the different layers of the neural network and not only calculated once like. A simple neural network is shown in the figure below.
