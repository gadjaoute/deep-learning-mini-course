The figure below describes a very simple and basic 2 layer neural network. There is an input layer where the dataset is passed into a hidden layer. In the hidden layer different “weights” are added to the inputs and those values are passed to the output layer where the response  ŷ is computed and returned. While in the figure below there is only one hidden layer it is possible to have more than one hidden layer. Using more hidden layers can allow the neural networks to create more accurate predictions with less loss, however then can require more computation.
