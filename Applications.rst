Deep learning has grown is popularity as we have more access to data, more powerful computation, and advancements in algorithms. Companies have used deep learning to solve labor intensive problems and develop new technologies never before seen. In this section we will cover ten applications of deep learning that can be seen today.

----------------------
**Self-driving Cars**
----------------------

Self driving cars have been under development over the last 100 years with the first semi-autonomous car experiment taking place in the 1920's. Since then there have been many different experiments done, however only with advancements in deep learning technology in the past few years have we seen successful autonomous driving cars. One of the companies at the forefront of self-driving cars is Tesla. Tesla has used deep learning neural networks trained with raw data taken from an array of sensors and cameras on their cars to train an neural networks with 48 networks that took 70,000 GPU hours to train. Their deep learning network outputs 1,000 distinct predictors to analyze at each time step. Using deep learning Tesla is able to create autonomous driving vehicles that are continuously learning while on the road.

**Healthcare**
---------------

The healthcare industry has many different applications for deep learning however one of the most prevalent uses is for **image analytics and diagnostics**. Using convolutional neural networks the healthcare industry has better been able to analyze images from x-rays and MRIs. By training deep learning neural networks with images from x-rays and MRIs showing positive diagnosis's, some neural networks have shown the same accuracy as industry professionals and in some cases more accurate. In a study published in the *Annals of Oncology* deep learning convolutional neural networks trained to identify melanoma from images were 10% more accurate in positively identifying melanoma than trained human clinicians.


-----------------
**Advertising**
-----------------

Data can be collected for users based on their search history, suggesting what users may be interested in. Deep Learning can then be used to infer what ads a person may be more likely to click on, and show them only those ads. 

--------------------------------
**Natural Language Processing**
--------------------------------

Deep Learning algorithms can be used to translate from speech to text by being trained to recognize the english language. This is used in many of today's voice recognition softwares.

---------------------
**Computer Vision**
---------------------

Deep Learning algorithms can be trained to recognize what objects are in images. This is applicable to industries such as self-driving vehicles, allowing cars to "see" and "understand" their surroundings.
